# CalenDont

## Description

A quick application that allows users to create an account, and then make plans and invite a friend who also has account. Our easy user interface allows someone who is invited to an event to anonymously decline. If BOTH attendees decline the event it will be cancelled.

Calendont is deployed on [Heroku](https://pacific-badlands-48977.herokuapp.com/).

The source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/rjr2/CalenDont).

Calendont uses JavaScript, Sequilize, Bootstrap, HandleBars, Express, MaxCDN, and MySQL.

## Credits

Guidance and debugging help was provided by University of Richmond Full Stack Bootcamp staff and resources.
